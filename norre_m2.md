## Project description
The Norrekaer Enge windfarm measurements is a significant part of the Riso programme for obtaining more knowledge on turbulence in windfarms, and loads on windturbines placed in farms and arrays in different types of terrain. The main goals of this programme are to obtain sufficient information on: 1)Loads on windturbines situated in arrays to enable the turbine designers to create more optimal designs. 2)Turbulence in the windfarms, such that more reliable models for loads and energy output can be created. Large amounts of data is available now from this particular set of measurements, in the form of a continous record of mean statistics, and additionally rapidly sampled timeseries that have been accumulated for a variety of conditions. The Norrekaer Enge measurements have been supported by the CEC under the JOULE programme, and by the Danish Ministry of Energy under the EFP?programme. The good cooperation of Nordtank and Nordkraft has been very helpful in the performance of these measurements. The Norrekaer Enge II Windfarm, containing 42 x 300 kW Nordtank turbines, is located in the North Jutland, on the south bank of the Limfjord, about 36 km west of Alborg and 8 km north east of Loegstoer. The terrain is old seabed and extremely flat, about 1 m above sea. The local terrain is however surrounded by small villages and significant terrain, with features up to 40 m in height, immediately to the south of the site. West of the site are farm buildings, rows of trees and the other windfarm : the Noerrekaer Enge I Windfarm, with 36 x 150 kW Nordtank turbines. Immediately north of the site there is water, Limfjord.

## Measurement system
Mast 1 at A1 is placed on the row of turbines A1 - A7, 55 m south of turbine Al. The Mast 2 at F6 is placed on the line between F6 and ES ( orientation 35.83° ), 55 m from F6 and the booms on both masts are perpendicular to the line F6 - E5. Mast Instrumentation The two meteorological masts are instrumented primarily for measuring profiles of mean speed, turbulence and temperature. For the prevailing south-westerly wind direction, mastl is an upstream mast, unaffected by wakes from wind turbines. In contrast mast2 is deep in the park and typically experiences wakes from a number of wind turbines. These two different roles are reflected somewhat in the instrumentation of the masts, with significantly more turbulence instrumentation on the wake mast (mast2). The instrumentation for each of the two masts are described below. Mast 1: Cup anemometers (3,10,23,31,44,58m) These are based on the standard Rise 70 type but have been modified in an attempt to improve the symmetry of the angular response. The modification takes the form of an dummy upper neck, mounted above the cup forming a mirror image of the lower neck. It is assumed that the length constant of the standard instrument (2m) has not been significantly changed by the modification. A two-pole magnet driven by the cup shaft is used to open and close a reed-contact switch, providing two pulses per revolution. Wind speed is derived by measuring the time for one complete rotation of the cup, using the Rise P2117 cup-timer interface. Prior to installation at Norrekaer but following a 2 month "run-in" period, the cups were individually calibrated in a wind tunnel. Boom length distance from centre of mast : cup,vane,temp : c. 2.5,2.1,2.0 Boom shape : 0 50x50 mm Height over boom : Cup, vane,temp,gill : 0.3,0.33,0.1,0.66 Boom arrangements : Pointing 312°. The wind direction vanes used were the Riso model 80 coupled with the Rise P1255 wind direction transmitter. This is an inductive system, using a commercially available direction resolver. The transmitter excites the resolver stator and de?modulates the sine and cosine signals from the perpendicularly offset resolver rotor windings. Sine and cosine signals are available as do analogue voltages. Using sine and cosine overcomes the problem of angular discontinuity (360-0°) and permits the use of a more robust and reliable resolver type. The vanes of the instrument are constructed from polystyrene giving a length constant of 0.7m and a damping ratio of 0.5. Temperature difference (23.3m, 58.3m) Temperature profiles are measured with purpose constructed temperature difference probes and signal conditioning (Rises P1867a Temperature Difference Transmitter). Matched PT500 probes are used (probes matched within 5m°C at 0°C, within 25m°C over the temp. range). The signal conditioning provides an output of +5V corresponding to +10°. The calibration were done by comparison to absolute PT500 hermometer with accredited traceable calibration. Absolute temperature (3m) Riso P1182 Temperature Transmitter, -5V..+5V corresponding to -25°C..+35°C. Calibrated by comparison to absolute PT500 thermometer with accredited traceable calibration.
